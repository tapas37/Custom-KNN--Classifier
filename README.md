A custom implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch in Python, compared with scikit-learn’s KNN for accuracy and performance.

# KNN from Scratch 🔍

This repository contains a custom implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python, along with a comparison to scikit-learn's implementation for evaluating accuracy and performance.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom KNN implemented from scratch using NumPy
- Comparison with scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier
- Accuracy scoring using both models

## 📁 Files

- knn_scratch.py – Custom KNN class
- knn_comparison.py – Script to compare with sklearn
- README.md – Documentation
- LICENSE – MIT License
